# eRNA Detect

This program takes RNA-seq data and detects bidirectionally read transcription sites in non coding regions.

Work in progress.

## To do:

* Detection of overlaps works, now to bring in GTF file and remove coding regions.
* FKPM of the overlaps? Or read count at least?
* Remove overlaps over a certain size. Needs internal bounds for the overlaps.
* Apply noncoding algorithm to the overlaps and eliminate those beyond the threshold?
